<p>Some observations and highlights of one week in California:</p>

<ul>
<li>Given the number of commercials for food on TV, it's no surprise my studio had no actual table (I have one coming in on Monday though).</li>
<li>Speaking of TV commercials: a 90 minute movie takes 3 hours because for every 10 minutes of movie, there's an accompanying 10 minutes of commercials.</li>
<li>More on food: there's seem to be enough food chains that you can eat in a different one each day of the month.</li>
<li>I managed to open a US bank account, because Apple Pay.</li>
<li>I stopped wearing a sweater after 4 days. The weather's just too gorgeous. </li>
<li>Got rid of the jetlag by Friday. I do am dog-tired every night I get home (I barely survived past 10pm this week). This was confirmed when I managed to sleep more than 3 hours during middle of the day on Saturday. </li>
<li>Related: I sleep a lot better with the airco on than off (I discovered after 3 nights).</li>
<li>Driving a car with automatic transmission is awkward at first, but so glorious once you get used to it.</li>
<li>I'm never going to get used to American food portions. Man.</li>
<li>No Starbucks yet (yay!), and Philz Coffee is pretty great (yay!).</li>
<li>They have Seinfeld on TV.</li>
<li>Did I mention the weather's pretty great out here?</li>
<li>Bay Area traffic sucks. Luckily my daily commute doesn't suffer from it.</li>
<li>2 more shootings happened in the US while I was here. The mind, it bends.</li>
<li>Bacon. </li>
<li>Most people are very nice and welcoming. This is especially true for the people I've met at Apple.</li>
<li>I don't know of a good Dutch word for "tailgating".</li>
<li>Finding a good way to pronounce my last name as something comprehensibly for Americans is quite the challenge.</li>
<li>Most drivers here are pretty disciplined. </li>
<li>When talking in myself (this is a healthy trait to have, okay?) I am now doing it in a combination of English and Dutch.</li>
<li>Why is everyone so crazy about crème brûlée?</li>
<li>I haven't made it to San Francisco. This Saturday night, I will.</li>
<li>Shopping in another country is strangely disconcerting. Even if a supermarket is just a supermarket, it's different enough to feel uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<p>And oh... Working at Apple has been great so far. Can't wait for more. </p>

<p>I've been a developer for while now... 18 years, to be exact. </p>

<p>I started in 1997, fresh out of university - without carrying any kind of degree, to be honest. I had learnt a lot there though: I had my first tastes of the internet there, and saw the web in its infancy, growing to a budding communication tool for a wide variety of people. And so I started in October 1997 as a web developer in an Antwerp-based company called iM@Gic. It was a fun place to work at, and we made some great sites there given the technology we had to our disposal (all coded in Perl, baby). </p>

<p><em>Update Sept 28th: this article is now also <a href="http://www.icapps.com/xcodeghost/">cross-posted</a> on the <a href="http://www.icapps.com/blog/">iCapps</a> blog, as part of their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iCappsiOSMonth">#iCappsiOSMonth</a> series in September 2015</em></p>

<p>Recently a malware issue for the iOS app store (which is a rarity in itself) called <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/20/xcodeghost-chinese-malware-faq/">XcodeGhost</a> made its appearance. I'm not going to go into the <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/novel-malware-xcodeghost-modifies-xcode-infects-apple-ios-apps-and-hits-app-store/">gory</a> <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/more-details-on-the-xcodeghost-malware-and-affected-ios-apps/">details</a>, but it boils down to a malware injection through a patched version of Xcode. When building iOS apps with such an Xcode, the app binary is modified transparantly, injecting malware into your app at runtime. Nothing is downloaded from the internet, the malware just gets compiled into your app.</p>

<p>There's not a lot you can do about this, except to make sure that you're using a legit Xcode. You can do this by <strong>never-ever</strong> downloading a version of Xcode from a location other than Apple's, which is either from the Mac App Store, or from <a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>) (I know this is easier said than done, saying this from my chair in the middle of super-connected Europe).</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that if you found this blog, you also know about a little piece of software I wrote a few years ago: <a href="https://github.com/ViewDeck/ViewDeck">ViewDeck</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/ViewDeck/ViewDeck/commit/463324184a67a7fa24c9207352298e69da0d66b7">initial commit</a> was on December 3rd, 2011. I'd been doing nearly a year of iOS development at that moment, and both the Facebook and Path apps came with this nifty new feature we now call "a hamburger menu". </p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://cl.ly/063X412a1i2U2e3f3D02/Image%202012.01.26%2023:26:55.png" width="240"> I remember finding it an interesting piece of user interaction and wondered how it was implemented, and so set out one night to try to recreate something like it myself. At that point, not an awful lot of libraries existed that recreated that UX, so I had no way to base my code on somebody elses creations. By the end of the night I had a mostly working prototype, and decided to continue working on it, and to share it with the world. After all it might come in handy for someone else and it was a fun way of showing of what I did (<strong>YEAH BABY</strong>).</p>

<p>I'd like to mention a trick I use often while debugging, a trick I learned from my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/qnoid">Markos Charatzas</a>: triggering a sound when a breakpoint is hit. It's a pretty simple but useful trick, especially if you're debugging repeatable actions and you want to know when they happen.</p>

<p>I'm talking about this:</p>

<p>I've been working on a largeish project for a client for the last few months. We're have to modularized our code into several sections using CocoaPods (this is a post worth on itself, really). </p>

<p>One of the problems you encounter with this approach is that for each pod, CocoaPods creates a bundle with resources for that pod (at least it does so when you tell it to do that). It's the only good way to package pod resources into the main app. This means that our resources do not all live in the main bundle but in seperate bundles (which themselves <strong>do</strong> live in the main bundle). This is no problem in itself, but it can cause loading problems of resources in those bundles. It doesn't pose that much of an issue when you specify images in a nib since iOS will search in the nib's bundle too, but it's a bit harder to get resources from within your code</p>

<p><a href="http://uikonf.com">UIKonf 2015</a>. It's been a while already, but I've too busy afterwards to do a decent writeup. I feel like I should though, because it's the first conference I attended where I was also a speaker (if you don't count my adhoc lightning talk at <a href="http://nsspain.com">NSSpain</a> last year, that is). Attending a conference as an announced speaker is different. Which was to be expected, of course.</p>

<p>I was working on a side project yesterday, a side project which I decided to develop using Swift. My day job mostly consists of Objective-C (which I still love) but all the hip kids are doing Swift and it doesn't hurt to keep along with the latest trend, right? And learning is fun.</p>

<p>So I was coding away, and I had this component which needed to notify several other components of certain events that happened. In practice this meant that I needed a sort of <em>multicast delegate</em>. Now, I could have solved this the old Cocoa way by using notifications, but I try to stay away from them unless it really makes sense. The contract they offer is pretty loose (which can be handy too), but I wanted to try something more set-in-stone right now.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://ikennd.ac/blog/2015/05/build-time-cfbundleversion-values-in-watchkit-apps/">this article</a> by Daniel Kennett this morning. I had seen him tweet about it too, but checking my feeds (yeah, I still do that, albeit not daily) I noticed he also made a post about it.</p>

<p>Having toyed a lot with build configurations and their associated settings configuration, I was curious how he solved the issue.</p>

<p>I'd have to concur with Daniel: the solution is horrible. 8 Steps to get this working, with aggregate targets and disabling of parallelization of the project: Not Good™.</p>

<p>But my interest was piqued, and so I tried to recreate his problem (not hard) and find a better solution. I assumed it would still be hacky, but less hacky than Daniel's "Horrible" solution.</p>
