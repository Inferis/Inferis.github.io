<p>It appears Apple changed something in the iOS bundle upload : it now requires that all executables in your app bundle are signed (this might be applicable for Mac uploads too, but I haven't tried). I hear you think: isn't this the case anyway, but there might be more executables in your bundle than you expect.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the binary for your app, which obviously is executable. But there could be more too: if you include shell scripts, for example, which are marked executable (<code>chmod u+x script.sh</code>) then iTunes Connect now considers them as actual executables and now requires them to be codesigned.</p>

<p>I went gliding! And it was awesome.</p>

<p>My friend and co-worker <a href="http://twitter.com/fousa">Jelle Vandebeeck</a> has been a glider pilot for (what he claims - and I have no reason to doubt it) 15 years now. Last year, just for fun, I mentioned I would like to get off the ground with him (in a glider, of course). He wasn't dismissive of it, so we went to search for a good date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts and weather conditions I didn't get the chance to actually go flying. No worries, there would be other moments.</p>

<p>And so, now that flying season started again, there were no races to be flown yet, the weather looked good and I was able to free some time (there's always so much to do, but it's about setting priorities), which meant that this weekend <strong>we were on</strong>!</p>

<p>I'm starting to become an early-morning person.</p>

<p>This is a big change for me. I used to be a "late night" person. My day used to consist of 2 parts: the day(job) part and the night part. Going home after work (or whatever) meant there were at least a few hours left in the day to be (even more) productive. And so I spent countless nights behind my computer's screen (because "being productive" equals "coding", that <em>is</em> imperative), coding away into the wee hours of night. The morning after would prove difficult but nothing that coffee couldn't solve. And the weekend usually gave good opportunities for sleeping in to catch up on some sleep. And so I was no morning person at all, meaning that "get up at 8am" was usually a very difficult task. Also, I had no fixed schedule in my life back then. I woke up when needed, I went to sleep when I felt like it, I rarely had breakfast/lunch/dinner at relatively fixed times.</p>

<p>The last <a href="http://nsconference.com">NSConference</a>. I'm happy to say I was there. I'm sad to see it go.</p>

<p>I attended three editions of NSConf. The first one was in 2013: due to scheduling reasons, I couldn't attend WWDC and so I was on the lookout for a replacement. NSConf seemed to be it, and I bought a ticket. I had known about NSConf before (given I'm relatively new to the Cocoa community, having only started in 2011), but I never got around to going. But buying that ticket was one of the best decisions ever made.</p>

<p>A tweet, 2 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day (including lunch at the Caffé Macs), a bucketload of mails and 2 handfuls of international phonecalls.</p>

<p>That's what got me a job in the UIKit team at Apple.</p>

<p>It's safe to say it's been a crazy ride so far, and it's about to get even better.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I like <a href="http://revealapp.com">Reveal</a>. It's such a great tool to discover why your UI doesn't appear as it should be. It's such a great way to get a decent look at the view hierarchy in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Initially, loading Reveal required you to add the reveal framework to your project before running. While not a hassle, it was rather suboptimal because you had to remove it again before shipping the app.</p>

<p>But when you run your project in the simulator, there's an easier way. Have it automatically start up the Reveal server, so that you don't have to connect manually, and don't have to pollute your project with a debugging lib. Why only in the Simulator? Well, the technique requires the dynamic loading of <code>libReveal.dylib</code>. This is possible on your Mac but not on your iOS device. And the Simulator runs on your Mac, so we can use this trick to load the Reveal lib at runtime without prerequiring it in the project (to be fair, you can dynamically load libs on the device, but you'd still need to add them to your project).</p>

<p>So let's do that. First on: some LLDB tricks.</p>

<p><em>(This blogpost expands on a number of tweets I published this evening)</em></p>

<p>I've been looking for change all my life I think. Not actively. Or sometimes more active than at other moments. I've never been somebody who values status quo or who gets stuck in habits. I rarely get up at the time each morning, I'm not bothered when I get to lunch at 1pm instead of 12:30. I don't have to take the car to work each day, or I have no problem with skipping my daily train routine for another route or transportation option.</p>

<p>Not sure where this comes from, but I'm kinda always on the lookout for new things. For example, I quite abruptly switched from .Net consultancy and programming to iOS development. This wasn't easy, you know. A whole new platform, a new language, a new way of doing things. But at the time I was given the opportunity to do this, and I took it with two hands. It was time for something new. Time to learn new things, time for change.</p>

<p>While traveling home from NSSpain yesterday, I got an idea for a new app. Nothing groundbreaking, and more on that later, but it required the use of health kit. I also decided to write this one in Swift, for fun and profit but mostly for fun (and perhaps also because practice makes perfect).</p>

<p>So I did manage to go to NSSpain this year. Having missed it last year, I had vowed to go this year. But intentions don't always work out in the end, so it was a really last minute decision to actually go (props for my team at <a href="http://icapps.com">iCapps</a> to deliver awesome results so that I actually <em>could</em> go - I am proud of you guys and girls!). Also, a <em>very big thank you</em> to <a href="http://twitter.com/lascorbe">Luis</a> for helping me find a way to Logroño, which proved harder than expected (booking everything last minute doesn't help, of course).</p>

<p>I'm very happy to have actually attended. The suddenly changed <a href="%7B%%20post_url%202014-09-19-goodbye%20%%7D">circumstances</a> before I left surely had an impact on my expierence. My thoughts and feelings were more at home than in Logroño, but I tried to make the best of it. Thought about "going back" several times, but I'm happy to have stayed. ;)</p>

<p>Now, enough with the emotionalism (is that even a word?), how was NSSpain?</p>
