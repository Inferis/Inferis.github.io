<p>I was working on a side project yesterday, a side project which I decided to develop using Swift. My day job mostly consists of Objective-C (which I still love) but all the hip kids are doing Swift and it doesn't hurt to keep along with the latest trend, right? And learning is fun.</p>

<p>So I was coding away, and I had this component which needed to notify several other components of certain events that happened. In practice this meant that I needed a sort of <em>multicast delegate</em>. Now, I could have solved this the old Cocoa way by using notifications, but I try to stay away from them unless it really makes sense. The contract they offer is pretty loose (which can be handy too), but I wanted to try something more set-in-stone right now.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://ikennd.ac/blog/2015/05/build-time-cfbundleversion-values-in-watchkit-apps/">this article</a> by Daniel Kennett this morning. I had seen him tweet about it too, but checking my feeds (yeah, I still do that, albeit not daily) I noticed he also made a post about it.</p>

<p>Having toyed a lot with build configurations and their associated settings configuration, I was curious how he solved the issue.</p>

<p>I'd have to concur with Daniel: the solution is horrible. 8 Steps to get this working, with aggregate targets and disabling of parallelization of the project: Not Good™.</p>

<p>But my interest was piqued, and so I tried to recreate his problem (not hard) and find a better solution. I assumed it would still be hacky, but less hacky than Daniel's "Horrible" solution.</p>

<p>The keywords here is "static site generator". This means that I build/generate the site locally on my machine, and then push it to a server on the internets for all you to see. There's no dynamic site running, built in PHP or ruby or whatever. Just plain HTML files, some CSS, a bit of Javascript and some images or videos.</p>

<p>Working on an app last week, I needed a way to respond to rotation events in a view controller. Since iOS8, the rotation APIs in <code>UIViewController</code> are deprecated:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">willRotateToInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">toInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="nf">duration</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSTimeInterval</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">duration</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Implement viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">fromInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">toInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="nf">duration</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSTimeInterval</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">duration</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Implement viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>

<p>As you can see, they want you to use <code>viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:</code> instead.
So, no problem, we'll just implement that method.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I'd like to stress this a little more: the reason they've changed these behaviors is for a reason. Your app mostly likely is way better off using adaptive layout using size classes, Auto Layout and manual corrections using the new transition callbacks.</em></p>

<p>Now, the only thing is: what if you need to know those "toInterfaceOrientation" or "fromInterfaceOrientation" value from the old APIs?</p>

<p>It appears Apple changed something in the iOS bundle upload : it now requires that all executables in your app bundle are signed (this might be applicable for Mac uploads too, but I haven't tried). I hear you think: isn't this the case anyway, but there might be more executables in your bundle than you expect.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the binary for your app, which obviously is executable. But there could be more too: if you include shell scripts, for example, which are marked executable (<code>chmod u+x script.sh</code>) then iTunes Connect now considers them as actual executables and now requires them to be codesigned.</p>

<p>I went gliding! And it was awesome.</p>

<p>My friend and co-worker <a href="http://twitter.com/fousa">Jelle Vandebeeck</a> has been a glider pilot for (what he claims - and I have no reason to doubt it) 15 years now. Last year, just for fun, I mentioned I would like to get off the ground with him (in a glider, of course). He wasn't dismissive of it, so we went to search for a good date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts and weather conditions I didn't get the chance to actually go flying. No worries, there would be other moments.</p>

<p>And so, now that flying season started again, there were no races to be flown yet, the weather looked good and I was able to free some time (there's always so much to do, but it's about setting priorities), which meant that this weekend <strong>we were on</strong>!</p>

<p>I'm starting to become an early-morning person.</p>

<p>This is a big change for me. I used to be a "late night" person. My day used to consist of 2 parts: the day(job) part and the night part. Going home after work (or whatever) meant there were at least a few hours left in the day to be (even more) productive. And so I spent countless nights behind my computer's screen (because "being productive" equals "coding", that <em>is</em> imperative), coding away into the wee hours of night. The morning after would prove difficult but nothing that coffee couldn't solve. And the weekend usually gave good opportunities for sleeping in to catch up on some sleep. And so I was no morning person at all, meaning that "get up at 8am" was usually a very difficult task. Also, I had no fixed schedule in my life back then. I woke up when needed, I went to sleep when I felt like it, I rarely had breakfast/lunch/dinner at relatively fixed times.</p>

<p>The last <a href="http://nsconference.com">NSConference</a>. I'm happy to say I was there. I'm sad to see it go.</p>

<p>I attended three editions of NSConf. The first one was in 2013: due to scheduling reasons, I couldn't attend WWDC and so I was on the lookout for a replacement. NSConf seemed to be it, and I bought a ticket. I had known about NSConf before (given I'm relatively new to the Cocoa community, having only started in 2011), but I never got around to going. But buying that ticket was one of the best decisions ever made.</p>

<p>A tweet, 2 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day (including lunch at the Caffé Macs), a bucketload of mails and 2 handfuls of international phonecalls.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I like <a href="http://revealapp.com">Reveal</a>. It's such a great tool to discover why your UI doesn't appear as it should be. It's such a great way to get a decent look at the view hierarchy in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Initially, loading Reveal required you to add the reveal framework to your project before running. While not a hassle, it was rather suboptimal because you had to remove it again before shipping the app.</p>

<p>But when you run your project in the simulator, there's an easier way. Have it automatically start up the Reveal server, so that you don't have to connect manually, and don't have to pollute your project with a debugging lib. Why only in the Simulator? Well, the technique requires the dynamic loading of <code>libReveal.dylib</code>. This is possible on your Mac but not on your iOS device. And the Simulator runs on your Mac, so we can use this trick to load the Reveal lib at runtime without prerequiring it in the project (to be fair, you can dynamically load libs on the device, but you'd still need to add them to your project).</p>

<p>So let's do that. First on: some LLDB tricks.</p>
