      <p class="post-meta">Posted: March 25, 2015</p>

      

<p>Let me introduce: <a href="https://github.com/inferis/SwiftyAs">SwiftyAs</a>. It's a tiny little library to provide sort of the same functionality as <code>as?</code> from Swift in Objective-C. Let me explain...</p>

<h2>The gist</h2>

<p>In Swift, you can use the <code>as?</code> operator to safely cast a variable to another type (albeit Optional). If the actual type at runtime doesn't match, Swift turns it into a <code>nil</code>, and otherwise you just get the variable as an optional. Pretty handy:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift highlight highlight"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">source</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">AnyObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">NSDictionary</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">array</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">source</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="kt">NSArray</span>
<span class="c1">// array = nil</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">dict</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">source</span> <span class="k">as</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="kt">NSDictionary</span>
<span class="c1">// dict = source</span></code></pre>

<p>Now with <strong>SwiftyAs</strong> you can do kind of the same in Objective-C:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="n">NSObject</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">source</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSDictionary</span> <span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="n">NSArray</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSArray</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// array = nil
</span><span class="n">NSDictionary</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSDictionary</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source</span></code></pre>

<p>There's nothing new under the sun here, and you can do exactly the same with an if statement and a <code>isKindOfClass:</code> check:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="n">NSObject</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">source</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSDictionary</span> <span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">source</span> <span class="nf">isKindOfObject</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="nf">Class</span><span class="p">]])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSArray</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>but that's more cumbersome and I think the SwiftyAs way is a lot more readable.</p>

<h3>Innards</h3>

<p>So how does this work?</p>

<p>SwiftyAs introduces a category on <code>NSObject</code>, providing a readonly block property taking a <code>Class</code> and returning an <code>id</code>. The class represents the desired type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="k">@property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nonatomic</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">strong</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">readonly</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">Class</span> <span class="n">ofClass</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>

<p>The implementation does nothing more then forementioned <code>isKindOfClass:</code> check, but in a block (since that is what the property represents):</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">__unsafe_unretained</span> <span class="n">Class</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="n">as</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">__weak</span> <span class="n">typeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">welf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">^</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Class</span> <span class="n">ofClass</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">welf</span> <span class="nf">isKindOfClass</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">ofClass</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">welf</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">nil</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>We need to do some trickery with passing self as weak, because there's no assurance (or obligation) that the <code>as</code> property block is going to used right away. You could take the block, store it somewhere else and call it later if you wanted. Although that's not the intended and common case use, we do have to cater for it.</p>

<p>And so we reference self as weak inside the block, so that any lingering <code>as</code> references won't cause the parent object to remain retained. And if the object's gone, we just return <code>nil</code> anyway which is kinda the intended behavior.</p>

<h3>Tiny but easy</h3>

<p>So it's a really tiny library (if you even could call it that?). It's just category on NSObject providing the <code>as</code> "keyword" in Objective-C. You can't use it on objects of type <code>id</code> because that's how categories work in Objective-C, but hey, I can live with that.</p>

<p>So there. Available as a CocoaPod, of course:</p>

<pre><code>pod 'SwiftyAs', '~&gt; 1.0'
</code></pre>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>The last <a href="http://nsconference.com">NSConference</a>. I'm happy to say I was there. I'm sad to see it go.</p>

<p>I attended three editions of NSConf. The first one was in 2013: due to scheduling reasons, I couldn't attend WWDC and so I was on the lookout for a replacement. NSConf seemed to be it, and I bought a ticket. I had known about NSConf before (given I'm relatively new to the Cocoa community, having only started in 2011), but I never got around to going. But buying that ticket was one of the best decisions ever made.</p>

<p>A tweet, 2 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day (including lunch at the Caffé Macs), a bucketload of mails and 2 handfuls of international phonecalls.</p>

<p>That's what got me a job in the UIKit team at Apple.</p>

<p>It's safe to say it's been a crazy ride so far, and it's about to get even better.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I like <a href="http://revealapp.com">Reveal</a>. It's such a great tool to discover why your UI doesn't appear as it should be. It's such a great way to get a decent look at the view hierarchy in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Initially, loading Reveal required you to add the reveal framework to your project before running. While not a hassle, it was rather suboptimal because you had to remove it again before shipping the app.</p>

<p>But when you run your project in the simulator, there's an easier way. Have it automatically start up the Reveal server, so that you don't have to connect manually, and don't have to pollute your project with a debugging lib. Why only in the Simulator? Well, the technique requires the dynamic loading of <code>libReveal.dylib</code>. This is possible on your Mac but not on your iOS device. And the Simulator runs on your Mac, so we can use this trick to load the Reveal lib at runtime without prerequiring it in the project (to be fair, you can dynamically load libs on the device, but you'd still need to add them to your project).</p>

<p>So let's do that. First on: some LLDB tricks.</p>

<p><em>(This blogpost expands on a number of tweets I published this evening)</em></p>

<p>I've been looking for change all my life I think. Not actively. Or sometimes more active than at other moments. I've never been somebody who values status quo or who gets stuck in habits. I rarely get up at the time each morning, I'm not bothered when I get to lunch at 1pm instead of 12:30. I don't have to take the car to work each day, or I have no problem with skipping my daily train routine for another route or transportation option.</p>

<p>Not sure where this comes from, but I'm kinda always on the lookout for new things. For example, I quite abruptly switched from .Net consultancy and programming to iOS development. This wasn't easy, you know. A whole new platform, a new language, a new way of doing things. But at the time I was given the opportunity to do this, and I took it with two hands. It was time for something new. Time to learn new things, time for change.</p>

<p>While traveling home from NSSpain yesterday, I got an idea for a new app. Nothing groundbreaking, and more on that later, but it required the use of health kit. I also decided to write this one in Swift, for fun and profit but mostly for fun (and perhaps also because practice makes perfect).</p>

<p>So I did manage to go to NSSpain this year. Having missed it last year, I had vowed to go this year. But intentions don't always work out in the end, so it was a really last minute decision to actually go (props for my team at <a href="http://icapps.com">iCapps</a> to deliver awesome results so that I actually <em>could</em> go - I am proud of you guys and girls!). Also, a <em>very big thank you</em> to <a href="http://twitter.com/lascorbe">Luis</a> for helping me find a way to Logroño, which proved harder than expected (booking everything last minute doesn't help, of course).</p>

<p>I'm very happy to have actually attended. The suddenly changed <a href="%7B%%20post_url%202014-09-19-goodbye%20%%7D">circumstances</a> before I left surely had an impact on my expierence. My thoughts and feelings were more at home than in Logroño, but I tried to make the best of it. Thought about "going back" several times, but I'm happy to have stayed. ;)</p>

<p>Now, enough with the emotionalism (is that even a word?), how was NSSpain?</p>

<p>So, am I the only one who manages to get sidetracked a lot when working on (personal) projects?</p>

<p>For example, I have a few generic components written for various projects. In the past I would just add a <code>vendor</code> folder to my project, put the component there and be done with it.</p>

<p>But I've become to like CocoaPods to much that I cannot get myself to use this simple approach anymore. The CocoaPods approach makes using external libs so clean that it feels dirty not to (unless there's no other option).</p>

<p>I've been planning to get on the iOS8 boat for a while now (well, since they announced it, actually). But as one with a full life, I haven't gotten around to actually do much. I played around with some Swift, watched some WWDC14 sessions but that's about it.</p>

<p>Until tonight: I want to start over again on <a href="http://dra.sh">Drash</a>. There's a half baked iteration made for iOS7 (the current app runs still on iOS6 but feels right into place on iOS7 thanks to its minimal interface). But iOS8 changes so much again that I feel that it's best to start over again.</p>

<p>But then this begs the question: Objective-C or Swift?</p>

<p>There's some pro and cons to both, I think.</p>

<p>I'm afraid of becoming obsolete.</p>

<p>There, I've said it.</p>

<p>Let me explain: I work in a highly competitive sector which changes rapidly. This is nothing new, of course. It's always been that way. But before, I was younger. Not that I'm really old now, but that big 4 slowly creeping closer doesn't count for nothing. But I guess this is not really about age: I'm happy to work in a team with a bunch of early 20 year olds and it feels that I can manage that just fine. Sure, there are "generational" differences but all in all it works out pretty nice (I can only hope they feel the same though).</p>
