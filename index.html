<p>That time of year again: june! Time for WWDC. A special WWDC: given my future plans, it'll be the last (in a while I guess) WWDC I'll be experience from "the outside". So this is the perfect opportunity to do <a href="/blog/2013/06/08/wwdc-predictions/">another</a> <a href="/blog/2014/05/29/wwdc-14/">predictions</a> post. üòâ</p>

<h2>Will see</h2>

<h4>iOS 9</h4>

<ul>
<li>more extensions: If not lock screen extensions, perhaps more interaction in Springboard. But not only that, more interaction between apps themselves (embeddable views?).</li>
<li>opening up Siri (so you can use it to open your own app or even make use of her services inside of your apps)</li>
<li>Side by side apps support for larger devices. Not sure if they're going to announce this now or leave it as a surprise when actually release the new iOS? Better multitasking overall (see a)</li>
<li>an update to WatchOS. I can see us getting 1.1 soon, but 2.0 will probably add native Watch apps. I previously was of the opinion that they would wait longer for native apps to gather more battery stats from current usage, but I since the battery is rarely an issue with daily Watch usage (for me at least) I can see them moving faster. It'll be interesting to see what the limits will be for Watchkit apps, because this is a whole different ballgame than the iPhone.</li>
<li>More HealthKit &amp; ResearchKit (including more integration with the Watch). Better ways to get data out (e.g. watch workouts?)</li>
<li>HomeKit. The introduction last year was clearly intended to get hardware vendors on the bandwagon, but this year should see more functionality.</li>
<li>Related to this: no new AppleTV hardware, but I do think we'll see an update to the software if only to accomodate the new HomeKit functionality (the AppleTV will act as a bridge between local hardware and your other devices, I think).</li>
<li>A retina Thunderbold display. A standalone retina iMac, let's say. Announced, but not immediately shippable. Seems like something developers will be very happy with (the needed hardware to drive it, apart from that Mac Pro, will come later).</li>
<li>general improvements to iCloud (more storage, better UI, improvements to CloudKit, ...). Probably in conjuction with a price drop for iCloud storage.</li>
<li>a significant update to the dev tooling. This includes Xcode but also things for continious integration. Additionally, I have a feeling that deployment might become a bit simpler given the current hassle with extensions etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last speculation is (IMHO) reinforced by the scheduled maintenance window today, which ends around the time the keynote should end (9PM CET = 12AM PST):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://c.inferis.org/image/2K3U0D3j2516/Image%202015-06-08%20at%2011.55.54%20am.png" width="750"></p>

<p>One can hope.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS8.4 with <em>Apple Music</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>But that's not really a surprise. I'm curious about the pricing, though.</p>

<h4>OSX 10.11</h4>

<ul>
<li>more integration with iOS. A better handoff, messages, ...</li>
<li>the demise of HFS+ (because you never know)</li>
<li>the breakup of iTunes into a Music only component and a sync app for syncing your iDevice with you Mac. Potentially I'd see them getting rid of that last part, forcing everybody to go to iCloud for syncing and backup (see price reduction above).</li>
<li>iCloud will become more prominent, I think. This will anger the Snow-Leopard-Was-The-Best purists, naturally.</li>
<li>a public UXKit (UIKit for the Mac)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Won't see</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jony Ive on stage (üëã White Room)</li>
<li>hints of new iOS devices</li>
<li>no new Macbook Pro's (üëã Intel)</li>
<li>A review of OSX by <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa">@siracusa</a>. üò¢</li>
</ul>

<p>So there. There's probably more but these are the things from the top of my head. It's more than enough, and you can't guess it all.</p>

<p>To be clear: I have <strong>no</strong> insider knowledge. This is pure guesswork. üòÅ And if I had, I wouldn't be doing a post like this.</p>

<p>I was working on a side project yesterday, a side project which I decided to develop using Swift. My day job mostly consists of Objective-C (which I still love) but all the hip kids are doing Swift and it doesn't hurt to keep along with the latest trend, right? And learning is fun.</p>

<p>So I was coding away, and I had this component which needed to notify several other components of certain events that happened. In practice this meant that I needed a sort of <em>multicast delegate</em>. Now, I could have solved this the old Cocoa way by using notifications, but I try to stay away from them unless it really makes sense. The contract they offer is pretty loose (which can be handy too), but I wanted to try something more set-in-stone right now.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://ikennd.ac/blog/2015/05/build-time-cfbundleversion-values-in-watchkit-apps/">this article</a> by Daniel Kennett this morning. I had seen him tweet about it too, but checking my feeds (yeah, I still do that, albeit not daily) I noticed he also made a post about it.</p>

<p>Having toyed a lot with build configurations and their associated settings configuration, I was curious how he solved the issue.</p>

<p>I'd have to concur with Daniel: the solution is horrible. 8 Steps to get this working, with aggregate targets and disabling of parallelization of the project: Not Good‚Ñ¢.</p>

<p>But my interest was piqued, and so I tried to recreate his problem (not hard) and find a better solution. I assumed it would still be hacky, but less hacky than Daniel's "Horrible" solution.</p>

<p>Working on an app last week, I needed a way to respond to rotation events in a view controller. Since iOS8, the rotation APIs in <code>UIViewController</code> are deprecated:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc highlight highlight"><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">willRotateToInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">toInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="nf">duration</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSTimeInterval</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">duration</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Implement viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">fromInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">UIInterfaceOrientation</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">toInterfaceOrientation</span> <span class="nf">duration</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">NSTimeInterval</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">duration</span> <span class="n">NS_DEPRECATED_IOS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">_0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Implement viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator: instead"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>

<p>As you can see, they want you to use <code>viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:</code> instead.
So, no problem, we'll just implement that method.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I'd like to stress this a little more: the reason they've changed these behaviors is for a reason. Your app mostly likely is way better off using adaptive layout using size classes, Auto Layout and manual corrections using the new transition callbacks.</em></p>

<p>Now, the only thing is: what if you need to know those "toInterfaceOrientation" or "fromInterfaceOrientation" value from the old APIs?</p>

<p>It appears Apple changed something in the iOS bundle upload : it now requires that all executables in your app bundle are signed (this might be applicable for Mac uploads too, but I haven't tried). I hear you think: isn't this the case anyway, but there might be more executables in your bundle than you expect.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the binary for your app, which obviously is executable. But there could be more too: if you include shell scripts, for example, which are marked executable (<code>chmod u+x script.sh</code>) then iTunes Connect now considers them as actual executables and now requires them to be codesigned.</p>

<p>I went gliding! And it was awesome.</p>

<p>My friend and co-worker <a href="http://twitter.com/fousa">Jelle Vandebeeck</a> has been a glider pilot for (what he claims - and I have no reason to doubt it) 15 years now. Last year, just for fun, I mentioned I would like to get off the ground with him (in a glider, of course). He wasn't dismissive of it, so we went to search for a good date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts and weather conditions I didn't get the chance to actually go flying. No worries, there would be other moments.</p>

<p>And so, now that flying season started again, there were no races to be flown yet, the weather looked good and I was able to free some time (there's always so much to do, but it's about setting priorities), which meant that this weekend <strong>we were on</strong>!</p>

<p>I'm starting to become an early-morning person.</p>

<p>This is a big change for me. I used to be a "late night" person. My day used to consist of 2 parts: the day(job) part and the night part. Going home after work (or whatever) meant there were at least a few hours left in the day to be (even more) productive. And so I spent countless nights behind my computer's screen (because "being productive" equals "coding", that <em>is</em> imperative), coding away into the wee hours of night. The morning after would prove difficult but nothing that coffee couldn't solve. And the weekend usually gave good opportunities for sleeping in to catch up on some sleep. And so I was no morning person at all, meaning that "get up at 8am" was usually a very difficult task. Also, I had no fixed schedule in my life back then. I woke up when needed, I went to sleep when I felt like it, I rarely had breakfast/lunch/dinner at relatively fixed times.</p>

<p>The last <a href="http://nsconference.com">NSConference</a>. I'm happy to say I was there. I'm sad to see it go.</p>

<p>I attended three editions of NSConf. The first one was in 2013: due to scheduling reasons, I couldn't attend WWDC and so I was on the lookout for a replacement. NSConf seemed to be it, and I bought a ticket. I had known about NSConf before (given I'm relatively new to the Cocoa community, having only started in 2011), but I never got around to going. But buying that ticket was one of the best decisions ever made.</p>

<p>A tweet, 2 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day (including lunch at the Caff√© Macs), a bucketload of mails and 2 handfuls of international phonecalls.</p>

<p>That's what got me a job in the UIKit team at Apple.</p>

<p>It's safe to say it's been a crazy ride so far, and it's about to get even better.</p>
