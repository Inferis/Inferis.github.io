<p>That time of year again: june! Time for WWDC. A special WWDC: given my future plans, it'll be the last (in a while I guess) WWDC I'll be experiencing from <em>the outside</em>. So this is the perfect opportunity to do <a href="/blog/2013/06/08/wwdc-predictions/">another</a> <a href="/blog/2014/05/29/wwdc-14/">predictions</a> post. üòâ</p>

<h2>Will see</h2>

<h4>iOS 9</h4>

<ul>
<li>more extensions: If not lock screen extensions, perhaps more interaction in Springboard. But not only that, more interaction between apps themselves (embeddable views?).</li>
<li>opening up Siri (so you can use it to open your own app or even make use of her services inside of your apps)</li>
<li>Side by side apps support for larger devices. Not sure if they're going to announce this now or leave it as a surprise when actually release the new iOS? Better multitasking overall (see a)</li>
<li>an update to WatchOS. I can see us getting 1.1 soon, but 2.0 will probably add native Watch apps. I previously was of the opinion that they would wait longer for native apps to gather more battery stats from current usage, but I since the battery is rarely an issue with daily Watch usage (for me at least) I can see them moving faster. It'll be interesting to see what the limits will be for Watchkit apps, because this is a whole different ballgame than the iPhone.</li>
<li>More HealthKit &amp; ResearchKit (including more integration with the Watch). Better ways to get data out (e.g. watch workouts?)</li>
<li>HomeKit. The introduction last year was clearly intended to get hardware vendors on the bandwagon, but this year should see more functionality.</li>
<li>Related to this: no new AppleTV hardware, but I do think we'll see an update to the software if only to accomodate the new HomeKit functionality (the AppleTV will act as a bridge between local hardware and your other devices, I think).</li>
<li>Swift: not sure. Mixins would be nice. I think we'll see the two languages (ObjC and Swift) come together more to improve interop (e.g. more annotations in the frameworks, but also better ways to integrate Swift components in Objective-C code). Objective-C is not going away soon, folks.</li>
<li>A retina Thunderbold display. A standalone retina iMac, let's say. Announced, but not immediately shippable. Seems like something developers will be very happy with (the needed hardware to drive it, apart from that Mac Pro, will come later).</li>
<li>general improvements to iCloud (more storage, better UI, improvements to CloudKit, ...). Probably in conjuction with a price drop for iCloud storage.</li>
<li>a significant update to the dev tooling. This includes Xcode but also things for continious integration. Additionally, I have a feeling that deployment might become a bit simpler given the current hassle with extensions etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last speculation is (IMHO) reinforced by the scheduled maintenance window today, which ends around the time the keynote should end (9PM CET = 12AM PST):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://c.inferis.org/image/2K3U0D3j2516/Image%202015-06-08%20at%2011.55.54%20am.png" width="750"></p>

<p>One can hope.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS8.4 with <em>Apple Music</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>But that's not really a surprise. I'm curious about the pricing, though.</p>

<h4>OSX 10.11</h4>

<ul>
<li>more integration with iOS. A better handoff, messages, ...</li>
<li>the demise of HFS+ (because you never know)</li>
<li>the breakup of iTunes into a Music only component and a sync app for syncing your iDevice with you Mac. Potentially I'd see them getting rid of that last part, forcing everybody to go to iCloud for syncing and backup (see price reduction above).</li>
<li>iCloud will become more prominent, I think. This will anger the Snow-Leopard-Was-The-Best purists, naturally.</li>
<li>a public UXKit (UIKit for the Mac)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Won't see</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jony Ive on stage (üëã White Room)</li>
<li>hints of new iOS devices</li>
<li>no new Macbook Pro's (üëã Intel)</li>
<li>A review of OSX by <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa">@siracusa</a>. üò¢</li>
</ul>

<p>So there. There's probably more but these are the things from the top of my head. It's more than enough, and you can't guess it all.</p>

<p>To be clear: I have <strong>no</strong> insider knowledge. This is pure guesswork. üòÅ And if I had, I wouldn't be doing a post like this.</p>

<p>So, it's that time of the year again. WWDC is almost upon us. <a href="">Like last year</a>,  I won't be able to make it due to "agenda issues" (mainly the same as last year, but that's what happens when you have kids). But also I'm in the midst of an app release at <a href="http://icapps.com">work</a> and as a team/tech lead it would be less than ideal to skip a week for WWDC (which is actually more than a week since there's the <em>Jetlag Recovery Period</em> too). So it wasn't in the stars this year.</p>

<p>I think I might be going again next year. Not sure if I will go for WWDC itself, but certainly for an AltWWDC experience. There's a lot of people going to SF next week which I'd really like to meet or talk to again. Sure, there's twitter, but nothing beats IRL contact. And the buzz around WWDC is just so invigourating, or at least it was in 2012, IMHO. So we'll see. I'll have some money set aside for next year, so at least that won't be a problem.</p>

<p>No real predictions post. You never know with Apple what they're going to produce at a developer event, so I won't go there.
What I will do is list what I'd like to see. Mostly iOS stuff, because that's what I do.</p>

<p>My predictions for the WWDC keynote:</p>

<ul>
<li>We won't see Jony Ive on stage</li>
<li>I'm guessing Federighi will take over Forestalls part (on the other hand, how mindbending it would be to have Forstall do the iOS part!)</li>
<li>Ive will do (at least one) video where he'll do his tilted head magic telling us how they designed the best iOS experience ever (it will be "truly the result of years of innovation and hard work").</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder if he'll manage to sneak in an "aluminium" in the iOS video, though.</p>

<p>It's almost WWDC. Next week, thousands for Apple developers will gather in Moscone West for a Grand Fest Of iOS and OSX Developer Excitement. <em>coughs</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3s0t0c2o4239090o360L/wwdc.png"></p>

<p>All fun aside: I was there last year, at WWDC 2012. I'm not going to be there this year. The cost of the whole trip is one factor, but this year some calendar "constraints" the weekend before WWDC made sure I could not go. Admittedly, that was my own fault since I planned those constraints myself. I'll be wanting to keep that in mind for next year when similar constraints will most likely appear near the WWDC date.</p>

<!-- read more -->

<p>So, alas, no WWDC for me. I was fine with this at first but now that it's so close I have to admit it stings a little bit that I'm not going to be present. Sure, there'll be videos every day and I presume the keynote will be live streamed, so it's not really about getting at the information you get at WWDC. That'll be available from my comfy chair at home too, of course. Another benefit of not going is: no queueing. There's an incredible amount of queueing to be done at WWDC. I'm not going to miss that, for sure.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2f3W0R0Z0f3M0V2Z2a1N/Image%202013.06.06%2017%3A35%3A59.jpeg" width="250" height="250"> What I will miss is the great atmosphere. I loved San Fransisco (or at least the part I saw). The weather last year around WWDC was really great (warm enough, sunny skies, no mist), so that probably changed the perception. Regardless, it seems like a friendly and warm city. I also loved the atmosphere at WWDC itself. The fact that you're there with a whole bunch of developers like yourself, well, that's something special. There's no awkwardness with discussing technical stuff over lunch. It was fun going to a session and then later chatting about it with somebody else. Or sharing session notes with other people who went to other sessions while taking a break. You could be waiting in line for a session and a really nice conversation would start off with somebody you'd never seen before (being at a conference of this size provides enough topics to talk about, I found). And while it sounds a bit like a platitude, I found everybody to be quite friendly. People were happy to have you seated next to them over lunch. A friendly american saw me struggling with my converters to juice up my iPhone, and promptly provided me with a spare US connector of his own ("I've got more than enough of them, feel free!").</p>

<p>Also, I spent most of the off-work time there with some of the Belgian fellow devs that were also attending WWDC (which was quite a sizable number actually). Most of them I hadn't seen (much) of, even here in Belgium, but they turned out to be really nice people. <em>waves</em> And while I can't say that we've seen each other a lot since then, I do feel that being at WWDC created a different kind of bond than for example meeting each other at <a href="http://cocoaheads.be/">CocoaHeadsBE</a> meetings. I had some great times with some of them over there (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/SuOW">Blue Crowbar Classic</a>, anyone?).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0f3m021p1u383D3o2l0j/Image%202013.06.06%2017%3A35%3A06.jpeg" width="250" height="250">  And while the trip was all work, it also felt a little bit like a vacation. It's hard to describe how tired I was every night from processing al the information I took in during the day. So it really felt like I was working, mentally speaking. But of course, it wasn't really like everyday work, so there's a difference. But still: I was beat when going to sleep at night (jetlag doesn't help either, of course). And like I said: it also felt like it was a little bit of vacation. I guess the great weather helped, and all the tourists in downtown SF too, but in a sense it was a very relaxing week. Tiring, but relaxing. I'm going to miss that too, this year. A working week off from regular work. Change of scenery helps.</p>

<p>So, let's hope I can go back to WWDC next year. It'll depend on the ticket lottery of course, and let's hope those calendar issues won't be a problem then. I'm already saving so that money won't be a real issue. What I did do was compensate for the lack of WWDC by going to a number of smaller conferences more nearby (read: UK). I'll talk about those in a later blogpost.</p>

<p>But still: WWDC is another ballpark, I guess. So yeah, I want to go back there and I have to admit I'm a bit jealous of those going.</p>
