Last week I saw this tweet from @annglorieus (working for Sony) passing by:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/annglorieus/status/376394778122158080 align=center %}

It was a video about the new cameras by Sony: the QX-10 and the QX-100. I say camera, but they're actually lenses without a body. A small part of the, eh, camera is for bookkeeping (featuring a battery, a micro SD card, battery indicator and a micro usb connection). But most of it: lens.

But anyway, looking at the video linked in the tweet, I immediately wanted to try these things out. So, after making sure this lens would actually work on my phone (I could see them having it only work with a Sony Android phone, but it works fine with an iPhone), I passed on my email address and soon had an invite in my mailbox for a local Sony event demonstrating these things.

Said event was pretty cool (nice to see @bunker, @saravdv, @boskabout and @mschenk again), and I even got to take one of the devices with me to test out. Since I had played with a QX-100, I got to take that one home, but I would have been just as happy with a QX-10. So there I was with a new photocamera to try out during two weeks.

## First Impressions

My first impressions after a few days with it? It's awesome, and it's not. Let me explain.

First of all: this is a pretty good camera. It's no SLR, but since that's not what I was expecting, that doesn't matter. For a point and shoot, this is an impressive piece of tech. The QX-100 is the more "pro" version, so it is more light sensitive than the QX-10. It doesn't zoom in as much as the QX-10, but the higher megapixel count makes up for that. 

Anyway, the camera takes awesome photos.

I love the bokeh it produces at large apertures (the QX-100 goes up to f/1.8). The large megapixel count takes pictures I can easily crop to _zoom in+. The colors it generates are vivid enough for my take. The compact for allows for special angles, angles which you won't be able to shoot from with a regular camera (said camera being a smartphone or a SLR). 

Which brings me to the not so awesome part of this device: the communication with your phone. The idea is great: since the camera doesn't have an interface, your smartphone becomes the interface. There are iOS or Android apps you can install which interface with the camera. So far so good, but the implementation is a bit lacking at the moment.

Firstly, the communication between the camera and the phone happens over wifi. The camera creates an adhoc wifi network which you need to connect to from your phone. You need to enter a password only the first time, but every time you boot up the camera and want to use it you have to go to settings to switch wifi networks. That is, if you are at a place where you have access to another wifi network - this clearly isn't a problem when your're on the road using a cellular connection: the phone will pick up the wifi once you start the camera. But since I've been using the device at my home, the problem poses itself quite a bit. Pretty annoying, but I guess there's no other way around it. This works better on Android devices with NFC connectivity: the camera as an NFC tag which triggers the app and configures the network for you: much less hassle to setup the connection. So yeah, this is an iOS limitation, but still: annoying but not really blocking.

But once you connected, the connection is flakey at times. There's a lot of data to push through the connection: there's a live preview of what the camera sees. Commands you give have to be transmitted over the network to the camera. And so: there's lag. I regularly get a spinner when the preview stops. Rotating the phone and/or the camera to landscape (the camera detects orientation itself) regularly hangs the display (rotating your phone again seems to help to fix that). Tapping the shutter button doesn't always result in an immediate shot. And sometimes the app just hangs and you need to restart it (but that might be the iOS7 beta OS acting up). Taking "action shots" becomes pretty hard in these conditions. For example: after the hedgehog shot above, I set up the camera so that I could take a shot at the hedgehog passing by (it had scuttled into a corner after the first shot, and I knew it would be passing again). And when the hedgehog passed by, I had a spinner on my phone and I wasn't able to take a shot. I was pretty bummed about it, to be honest.

Because that's the great thing about this camera: you can place it somewhere, and "hide" somewhere else (nearby obviously) to control it. The hedgehog shot would have been pretty cool if I would have been able to take it. But this great thing
