At the latest iCapps Monthly Teammeeting (today!), I presented our developers with a small Swift test.
It was supposed to be a bit tongue in cheek, but also a bit serious. This new language coming out of Apple is pretty new but also here to stay, so it can't hurt to get on the bandwagon sooner rather than later. A few of us got to go to WWDC and see everything for themselves, the rest of us maybe spent some time with the videos or even started coding but I guess the majority hasn't really gotten around to seriously looking at this new language.

And so, to spike the interest a bit more, I made this little test to see how much we all knew about Swift. It's not complete by far and it only touches on a few specifics, but I had it set up as a multiple choice test so it was kind of hard to touch on every feature in the language (for example: try asking a question on the brand new enum syntax without spoiling it). And the main goal was to show the difference from Objective-C.

The results were fascinating. There were 13 questions, and the number or correct answers ranged from 11 to 5. Most of the developers were around 6 or 8 correct answers. Two people managed to score 11 points.

Also, people seemed to like it even though it was a test. It was obvious it was "for fun", but after the session it spike several conversations about some of the topics touched. So that was a success, I guess.

There's also a slide deck with the answers which I'm not going to embed but just link to so you can take [a peek](http://cl.ly/2e300O3t2E1s) if you want.
