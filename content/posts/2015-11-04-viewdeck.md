This is a follow-up post to [this post](/blog/2015/09/14/wanted-new-maintainer-for-viewdeck/), wherein I started a quest for a new ViewDeck maintainer. I say quest, but I actually meant "let's just throw it out there and see how it goes". 

So I had already left for my job at Apple and had my first work day there done, when I received a DM from [Michael Ochs](https://twitter.com/_mochs), asking if I had already found a new maintainer. To be honest, at that point, I was a bit afraid I might not find one. That was fine it itself, but I really wanted to "disconnect" myself from the project, even though I hadn't really touched it in a few years.

But here was Michael, volunteering for the job. While I haven't met him in person we did talk a few times over the interwebs, and he's felt like a perfect fit for the job. And so I added him to the [ViewDeck organisation](http://github.com/ViewDeck) so he could start playing his role.

As far as I could follow, he's been doing an admirable job. Responding to PRs, categorizing, tagging and replying to issues, cleaning things up, and [moving things forward](http://www.ios-coding.com/blog/2015/11/01/maintaining-viewdeck/). Exactly what ViewDeck needed: some fresh blood to get things going again.

And I'm very happy with that.

Today, I have removed myself as an admin and member from the ViewDeck organisation, and made myself an "outside collaborator":

I have played my role in this project and now it's time for somebody else to do that. My commits are there forever and I keep a private copy (right until when Michael took over) for myself. I technically can still commit and push, but I won't be doing any of that. 

So thank you, Michael, and have fun with it. It seems you'll be doing a mighty fine job. ðŸ˜‰
