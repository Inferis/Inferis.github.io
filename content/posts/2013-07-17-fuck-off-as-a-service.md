This is just pure genius: fuck off as a service. As the site says:

	FOAAS (Fuck Off As A Service) provides a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common problem of telling people to fuck off.

So simple and elegant. It even does content negotiation.  
Also: I love how they have a roadmap.

Now all they need is a shorter domain name because *foaas.herokuapp.com* is too long to type. I checked: [foa.as](http://www.nic.as/) is still available.

The internet needs more of this.
