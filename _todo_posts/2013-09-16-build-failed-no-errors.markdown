Starting on a new (but existing project), I was greeted with the following error this morning:

{% img http://cl.ly/image/2k1N2j0t2J2O/Image%202013.09.16%2012%3A04%3A32.png 500 %}

The build failed, but there were no errors. Normally, you get a nice red icon indicating something went wrong:

{% img http://cl.ly/image/2k1N2j0t2J2O/Image%202013.09.16%2012%3A04%3A32.png 500 %}

But in this case: failure. The build would not run, but no visual indication of what was wrong. Also, no error in the error sidebar.
